# Mysql


맥에서  brew를 통해 mysql 설치후 패시워드 초기화하는 부분에서 초기화가 진행 안되는 문제발생.  
아래처럼 처리했다.  
출처는 스택오브플로우  



I had some directories left from another mysql(8.0) installation, that were not removed.

I solved this by doing the following:  

First uninstall mysql
```
    brew v
```
Delete the folders/files that were not removed
```
    rm -rf /usr/local/var/mysql
    rm /usr/local/etc/my.cnf
```
Reinstall mysql and link it
```
    brew install mysql@5.6
    brew link --force mysql@5.6
```
Enable and start the service
```
    brew services start mysql@5.6
```
